# gmoTax

A new law has been passed that mandates a tax on genetically modified food. A certain farmer decides to increase the price of his goods by 15% in response, and wants your help on analyzing the difference. Given the farmerâ€™s catalog of original prices and a category name, your task is to return the sum of all price increases for foods in that category after the 15% increase (round to the nearest cent).

NOTE: You are required to use at least one filter. Pros can use reduce to make their code even more functional-style.
